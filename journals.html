            <h2>Avoidance Journal For Anxiety</h2>

            Write down or type out what the situation was, how much anxiety you were feeling and wether you pushed through the situation or avoided it.

            <h2>Negative Thoughts Journal</h2>
            <p><strong>How:</strong> Throughout the day, or at the end of the day notice what negative thoughts you've been having. Write them down, and then for each
            one write down the <strong>evidence for this thought</strong> and <strong>evidence against this thought.</strong> Then after that write down what 
        <strong>a more realistic thought</strong> would be. Alot of times the negative thoughts we have are just "automatic negative thoughts" that aren't based in reality or
    how we really are.</p>

            <h2>Free Writing Journal</h2>
            <p><strong>How:</strong> Don't give this one too much thought, just open up a page, and write whatever comes to mind. If you've been stressed you may find that writing or typing it
            all out can really help relieve that stress, or if your mind has been feeling loud writing it all out can help you return to a sense of calm.</p>

            <h2>Dream Journal</h2>
            <p><strong>How:</strong> The first step is before bed to set the intention: <strong>I'm going to write down whatever dreams I have tonight.</strong> Then throughout the night (if you wake up in the night) or in the
            morning write out whatever you remember of your dreams, no matter how small. As you continue this practice you may notice you start remembering more and more dreams, as well as the dreams
        becoming clearer and more vivid. This practice can also improve sleep quality.</p>

            <p><strong>How: </strong>This journal is to help you to see paterns in how you feel after eating certain foods, to help you find what foods give you energy and make you feel good and which foods tend to bring you down.
